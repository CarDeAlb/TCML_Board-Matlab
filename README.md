# TCML_Module-Matlab
In this project are presented tools to command stepper-motor-modules from Trinamic using Matlab.

These tools are scripts to send and read commands from the boards manufactured by Trinamic to control stepper motors. These scripts were tested on different versions of Matlab and particularly on the board TMCM-351 v1.1, Firmware v4.17 and update-Firmware v4.48. 

The scripts were not written for commercial propose and are open to be freely distributed and/or modified. Matlab, Trinamic, TLML and TMCM-351 are registered and their rights owe the respective owners. For further information about the devices see: Trinamic Motion Control GmbH & Co. KG http://www.trinamic.com

Requirements: 
- Windows 7, 8, and 10
- Matlab 7.6 (or higher)
   The drivers for the modules should be already installed.
